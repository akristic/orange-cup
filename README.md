# Orange Cup
 Udacity Capstone Project for Full stack ND
 -----

 ### Introduction

 Orange cup is tennis web app for keeping score of tennis matches. It is a backend API created for Udacity Capstone Project for Full stack ND. This is backend for site that allows user to login, create players and matches and share them with the world. My motivation for this project is that after completing this Nanodegree I will continue to work on this project and make professional web site that will be connected with android app Orange Cup.
 You can find sample of this project on heroku: https://orangecup.herokuapp.com/


#### Virtual Enviornment

It is recommended working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organaized. Instructions for setting up a virual enviornment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

#### PIP Dependencies

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by naviging to the `/` root directory and running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
##Create database
 - create database in psql with name "orange"

## Running the server
From within the root directory first ensure you are working using your created virtual environment.
To run the server, execute:

```bash
export FLASK_APP=app
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```
Setting the `FLASK_ENV` variable to `development` will detect file changes and restart the server automatically.


# For testing endpoints in postman you will need VALID token.
This token will be provided to Udacity in submission. (2 Tokens. One for User and one for Admin)

To get your own tokens you will need to make your own account on Auth0. And in auth/auth.py file you will need to change
AUTH0_DOMAIN = 'orangecup.auth0.com'
API_AUDIENCE = 'orange'
to values from your account.
There are 2 roles setup in Auth0:
 - User with permissions:
    - read:matches
    - read:players
    - read:settings
    - write:matches
    - write:players
read:players and read:matches is actually not needed because currently everyone can read players and matches

  - Admin with permissions:
    - read:matches
    - read:players
    - read:settings
    - write:matches
    - write:players
    - write:settings
    - delete:matches
    - delete:players
    - delete:settings

To login create link like this:
https://orangecup.auth0.com/authorize?audience=orange&response_type=token&client_id=fXWf5reNlyMSgq4TjxQ23vvhtYFrZzsV&redirect_uri=https://localhost:8080/login-results
but change values with ones from your account

After successfully login you will be redirected to login-result page but because there is no frontend you will land on This site canâ€™t be reached page. Just copy token from url created in your browser. It will look something like this:

# Testing with Postman
Import collection in postman from file: orange-cup-endpoint-test-collection.postman_collection
In postman under Authorization tab select Type of authorization to OAuth 2.0. Use newly created token and paste it in Access Token box.
Important: Run all POST test under admin folder to populate database. Do this 3 or more times to have at least 3 rows in database. First create 3 players, than 3 settings and than 3 matches. Order is important because you can't create matches without valid player and settings primary keys.
